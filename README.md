By default there will be three different cars, and each time you press the start button the property velocity of the cars will be randomized between a value from 1 to 8, and they will advance the value of velocity in pixels to the right every 5 miliseconds, once the first car arribest to the end-line a winner will be declared. You can restart the race with new velocity values by pressing again the start button.
